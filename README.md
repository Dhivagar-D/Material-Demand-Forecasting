#  Materials Demand Forecasting ML 

A full-stack Machine Learning project for forecasting product demand and optimizing inventory management in supply chains.
 
---

##  Overview

This project predicts product demand using historical retail data and provides actionable insights for inventory planning. It integrates:

*  Machine Learning (Random Forest)
*  Flask Backend API
*  Interactive Frontend (HTML + Chart.js)

---

##  Features

*  Demand prediction using ML model
*  REST API for real-time forecasting
*  Inventory recommendations (stock, cost, safety stock)
*  Weather & seasonal impact analysis
*  Monthly demand forecasting
*  Product recommendations and clustering

---

##  Machine Learning Model

* Model: Random Forest Regressor
* Accuracy: ~99% R² Score
* Features Used:

  * Inventory Level
  * Price & Discount
  * Weather Condition
  * Seasonality
  * Competitor Pricing
  * Historical sales data
